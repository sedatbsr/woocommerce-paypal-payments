# PCP Tests

Monorepo for Playwright tests. Depends on [`@inpsyde/playwright-utils`](https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils) package.

## Folder structure

Tests for PCP project are stored under the __tests/qa__ dir.

### Project structure

- `resources` - files with test-data, images, project related installation packages, types, etc.

- `tests` - test specifications. For payment plugins contains following folders:
	
	- `01-plugin-foundation` - general tests for plugin installation, uninstallation, activation, deactivation, display of plugin in __WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments__.

	__The rest of the tests will be added over time__

	\* - folders are numerated on purpose, to force correct sequence of tests - from basic to advanced. Although each test should be independent and work separately, it is better to start testing from `plugin-foundation` and move to more complex tests.

	\*\* - folders and numeration can be different, based on project requirements.

- `utils` - project related utility files, built on top of `@inpsyde/playwright-utils`.

	- `admin` - functionality for operating dashboard pages.

	- `frontend` - functionality for operating frontend pages, hosted checkout pages (payment system provider's pages).

	- `test.ts` - declarations of project related test fixtures.

	- other project related functionality, like helpers, APIs, urls.

- `.env`, `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json` - see below.

### Installation as a node package

1. Remove `"workspaces": [ "playwright-utils" ]` from `package.json`.

2. In the root of the monorepo run following command:

```bash
npm run setup:tests
```

### Installation for local development

1. Add `"workspaces": [ "playwright-utils" ]` to `package.json`.

2. Delete `@inpsyde/playwright-utils` from `/node_modules`.

3. In the root of the project (which is __qa__ in this case) run following command:

	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils.git
	```

	[`@inpsyde/playwright-utils`](https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils) repository should be cloned as `playwright-utils` right inside the root directory of project.

4. Restart VSCode editor. This will create `playwright-utils` instance in the source control tab of VSCode editor.

5. Run following command:

	```bash
	npm run setup:utils
	```

6. `@inpsyde/playwright-utils` should reappear in node_modules. Following message (coming from `tsc-watch`) should be displayed in the terminal:

	```bash
	10:00:00 - Found 0 errors. Watching for file changes.
	```

7. If you plan to make changes in `playwright-utils` keep current terminal window opened and create another instance of terminal.

## Project configuration

Project requires a working WordPress website with WooCommmerce, `.env` file and configured Playwright.

1. [SSE setup](https://inpsyde.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AT/pages/3175907370/Self+Service+WordPress+Environment) - will be deprecated in Q1 of 2025.

2. Tested user with Administrator role should be created
  
2. In the Dashboard navigate to __Settings -> Permalinks__ and select `Post name` in __Permalink structure__ for correct format of REST path.

3. Install __Storefront__ theme.
   
4. Install __WooCommerce__ plugin.

5. In __WooCommerce -> Settings -> Advanced -> REST API__ create _Consumer Key_ and _Secret_ with Read/Write permissions and store them in `.env`.

6. To avoid conflicts make sure any other payment plugins like are deleted.

7. Configure `.env` file following [these steps](https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#env-variables). See also `/tests/qa/.env.example`.

8. Configure `playwright.config.ts` of the project following [these steps](https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#playwright-configuration).

9. Reporting to __Xray in Jira__ is configured [this way](https://github.com/inpsyde/playwright-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#reporting-to-xray-in-jira).

## Run tests

To execute tests, in the terminal, navigate to the __qa__ directory of the project (e.g. `cd tests/qa`) and run following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

### Additional options to run tests from command line

- Add scripts to `package.json` of the project (eligible for Windows, not tested on other OS):

	```json
	"scripts": {
		"test:smoke":  "npx playwright test --grep \"@Smoke\"",
		"test:critical": "npx playwright test --grep \"@Critical\"",
		"test:ui": "npx playwright test --grep \"UI\"",
		"test:functional": "npx playwright test --grep \"Functional\"",
		"test:all": "npm run test:ui & npm run test:functional"
	},
	```

	Run script with the following command:

	```bash
	npm run test:critical
	```

- Run several tests by test ID (on Windows, Powershell):

	```bash
	npx playwright test --grep --% "WOL-123^|WOL-124^|WOL-125"
	```

	It may be required additionally to specify the project (if tests relate to more then one project):

	```bash
	npx playwright test --project "project-name" --grep --% "WOL-123^|WOL-124^|WOL-125"
	```

## Autotest Execution workflow

1. Create Test Execution ticket in Jira, named after the tested plugin version, for example "Test Execution for v2.3.4-rc1, PHP8.1".

2. Link release ticket (via `tests: WOL-234`).

3. Set Test Execution ticket status `In progress`.

4. Add/update test execution ticket key in `.env` file of the project (`TEST_EXEC_KEY`).

5. Download tested plugin `.zip` package (usually attached to release ticket) and add it to `/project/<project-name>/resources/files`. You may need to remove version number from the file name.

6. Optional: delete previous version of tested plugin from the website if you don't execute __plugin foundation__ tests.

7. Start autotest execution from command line for the defined scope of tests (e.g. all, Critical, etc.). You should see `Test execution Jira key: WOL-234` in the terminal.

8. When finished test results should be exported to the specified test execution ticket in Jira.

9. Analyze failed tests (if any). Restart execution for failed tests, possibly in debug mode:

	```bash
	npx playwright test --grep --% "WOL-123^|WOL-124^|WOL-125" --debug
	```

10. Report bugs (if any) and attach them to the test-runs of failed tests (Click "Create defect" or "Add defect" on test execution screen).

11. If needed fix failing tests in a new branch, create a PR and assign it for review.

12. Set Test execution ticket status to `Done`.

## Coding standards

Before commiting changes run following command:

```bash
npm run lint:js:fix
```
